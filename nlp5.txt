<p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a collection of powerful interrelated technologies that can be used to perform complex tasks autonomously and without explicit human guidance. Machine learning (ML) lies at the core of AI, and when combined with other technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing and robotics represents a potential step change in what’s possible for humanity. </p>

<p> Since the launch of Australia’s Artificial Intelligence Roadmap in November 2019, we’ve seen an ever-growing repository of practical AI applications. AI represents a new way of applying science and will help humanity tackle some of our most stubborn and significant challenges. AI will assist us to solve the current COVID-19 crisis and help to protect us from future disease risks. </p>
<p> Perhaps one of the most immediate and urgent applications of AI is the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. In January, Google’s DeepMind published an article about its ML system, AlphaFold, in research journal Nature. AlphaFold can predict the 3D structure of a protein based on its genetic sequence far more quickly and accurately than pre-existing approaches. Knowing the structure of a protein associated with a virus allows scientists to develop vaccines and therapeutics. In March, DeepMind released structure predictions of several under-studied proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. </p>
<p> CSIRO has been working on SARS CoV-2 since January, and on 2 April, announced it was testing potential COVID-19 vaccines at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (CDP) in Geelong, Victoria. The process is expected to take three months. CDP Scientists and technicians are working to produce 50 litres of a candidate vaccine, a specially designed protein developed by the University of Queensland. This will provide about 20,000 vaccine doses for use in the first phase of clinical testing. Additional testing is being done to determine the best way of administering the vaccine. </p>
<p> Underpinning the CPD vaccine trials is research by CSIRO’s Australian e-Health Research Centre (AEHRC) examining the genome of COVID-19. The genome can be thought of as the virus’ blueprint. With several hundred virus strains decoded and deposited into a global repository daily, the dataset for this genomic analysis has rapidly expanded to tens of millions of data points. Each data point potentially holds information about the virus’ future trajectory and virulence of individual strains. </p>
<p> To manually study each data point would be impossible, like searching for a needle in a haystack. Advanced AI-related technologies are needed to attack this dataset. The AEHRC is using ML to map the evolutionary landscape the virus occupies and estimate its trajectory to help choose the most representative strain on which to test the vaccines. </p>
<p> “AI represents a new way of doing science and will help humanity tackle some of our most stubborn and significant challenges... it will assist us to solve the current COVID-19 crisis.” </p>
<p> Better forecasting </p>
<p> Within the field of epidemiology — the study of how diseases spread — AI is being used to improve the accuracy and timeliness of epidemiological forecasts. For example, researchers at the University of Texas used an AI ML approach — a “modified stacked auto-encoder” — to forecast COVID-19 cases across China from 11 January–27 February. When actual COVID-19 cases were compared to predicted ones, average accuracy ranged from 97.7 to 99.3 per cent. The researchers conclude that, if the data are correct and there are no “second transmissions” they can accurately forecast transmission dynamics of COVID-19 within Chinese provinces. </p>
<p> Another forecasting system developed by Data61 uses AI tools such as ML, natural language processing, data science and time series modelling to forecast disease spread from social media. The system was used to predict the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Africa three months before it happened. Tracking keywords such as “fever”, “cough”, “headache” and “head cold” has been successful in early outbreak detection of epidemics. In the current COVID-19 crisis, Data61 and AEHRC are working with state health organisations for early outbreak detection from social media, patient testing and hospitalisation data. Better forecasts enable better containment policies and fewer deaths. </p>
<p> There are limitations with the use of social media and internet search terms in predicting influenza. Researchers found Google flu trends alone to be an unreliable forecasting model. However, more recent AI-enabled research, which combines search term data with traditional epidemiological data, is promising. These approaches make use of cutting-edge ML techniques. For example, a recently developed ML forecasting model — ARGO2 — combines Google search terms with disease surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers observed a 30 per cent error reduction in real-time regional tracking of influenza across the US. </p>
<p> Key to reducing the number of deaths from COVID-19 will be ensuring our hospital system is prepared. AI can help achieve this. The AEHRC data analytics team has built models to understand the flow of patients through the healthcare system and the impact on different parts of the hospital. This has shown early discharge planning can improve patient movement from the emergency department to specialist wards, reducing the “access block” in the hospital. The team has also developed forecasting models to predict and track epidemics. In the case of COVID-19, researchers from AEHRC are working with various state health organisations, using various AI techniques to forecast the number of patients likely to need hospitalisation, hospital beds and ventilators, and helping ambulance services predict demand. </p>
<p> Addressing the future </p>
<p> To mitigate the risks of future pandemics, ML is being used for the detection and prediction of reservoirs of zoonotic (of animal origin) disease. As with SARS and H1N1, COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease. According to WHO, 61 per cent of all human infectious diseases are zoonotic — as are 75 per cent of emerging infectious diseases. In a recent study, researchers at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and the University of Georgia in the US used ML to identify species of rodents, and geographic locations, harbouring zoonotic pathogens. This can be used to help in surveillance, vector control and support research into effective vaccines and therapeutics. A recent review paper published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal describes several documented ways ML is being used to combat infectious diseases. These include predicting clinical outcomes for Ebola patients, predicting patients at risk of developing septic shock, and predicting the risk of infectious diarrhoea in patients who are hospitalised. </p>
<p> One of the biggest challenges facing healthcare authorities is ensuring citizens are receiving and using accurate information so they can take precautions. A large amount of misinformation is circulated on social media about COVID-19 — such as ineffective/dangerous treatments and preventative measures and over- or understated risks. Data61 has developed an algorithm that uses ML and natural language processing to identify and filter misinformation on Twitter. It was successfully used to identify bot-generated misleading posts on Twitter during the 2019–20 bushfires. The tool can also alert authorities to misleading information. </p>
<p> AI represents a novel, rapidly growing and powerful tool within the scientist’s toolkit — a new way of thinking and problem-solving. Corporate boards must ramp up science and technology investment to solve the COVID-19 crisis, stop future outbreaks and tackle a wide range of pressing societal and business problems. </p>

<p> SARS-COV-2 has roused the scientific community with a call to action to combat the growing pandemic. At the time of this writing, there are as yet no novel antiviral agents or approved vaccines available for deployment as a frontline defense. Understanding the pathobiology of COVID-19 could aid scientists in their discovery of potent antivirals by elucidating unexplored viral pathways. One method for accomplishing this is the leveraging of computational methods to discover new candidate drugs and vaccines in silico. In the last decade, machine learning-based models, trained on specific biomolecules, have offered inexpensive and rapid implementation methods for the discovery of effective viral therapies. Given a target biomolecule, these models are capable of predicting inhibitor candidates in a structural-based manner. If enough data are presented to a model, it can aid the search for a drug or vaccine candidate by identifying patterns within the data. In this review, we focus on the recent advances of COVID-19 drug and vaccine development using artificial intelligence and the potential of intelligent training for the discovery of COVID-19 therapeutics. To facilitate applications of deep learning for SARS-COV-2, we highlight multiple molecular targets of COVID-19, inhibition of which may increase patient survival. Moreover, we present CoronaDB-AI, a dataset of compounds, peptides, and epitopes discovered either in silico or in vitro that can be potentially used for training models in order to extract COVID-19 treatment. The information and datasets provided in this review can be used to train deep learning-based models and accelerate the discovery of effective viral therapies. </p>
<p> Introduction </p>
<p> Coronaviridae is a viral family responsible for causing pneumonia-like symptoms that has been a global threat since its first outbreak in 2002 (Jabeer Khan et al., 2020). Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), emerging in 2002 and 2013, respectively, caused diseases marked by both gastrointestinal and pulmonary dysfunction (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013). In 2019, SARS-COV-2 was the causative agent of a third Coronavirus outbreak and has been identified as the virus responsible for COVID-19, the symptoms of which range from those of the common cold to more severe respiratory failure (Kong W.-H. et al., 2020). Despite its having been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has continued to spread and has infected at least 20 million individuals, reaching a death toll of over half a million at the time of this review (Worldometer, 2020). </p>
<p> While hospitals are resorting to trial and error tactics for COVID-19 drug discovery, Virtual Screening (VS) has emerged as a popular method for discovering potent compounds due to the inefficiency of lab-based high throughput screening (HTS) (Jin et al., 2020; Kandeel and Al-Nazawi, 2020). VS for rational drug discovery is essentially an approach that involves computationally targeting a specific biomolecule (e.g., DNA, protein, RNA, lipid) of a cell to inhibit its growth and/or activation (Shoichet, 2004; Lionta et al., 2014). Structure-based and ligand-based drug discovery and design are two important subgroups of this type of screening (Lionta et al., 2014; Yu and Mackerell, 2017; Arshadi et al., 2020; Broom et al., 2020). Given our access to computationally and experimentally determined viral protein structures (Senior et al., 2020; Zhang L. et al., 2020), VS provides a rapid and cost-effective strategy for identifying antiviral candidates. </p>
<p> Additionally, conventional vaccine discovery methods have been costly, and it may take many years to develop an appropriate vaccine against a specified pathogen. In the early 1990s, the introduction of a genome-based vaccine design approach dubbed “Reverse Vaccinology” (RV) (Rappuoli, 2000; Bullock et al., 2020), revolutionized the field to a more efficient status, due in part to the fact that bacterial culturing was no longer required for identifying vaccine targets (Bruno et al., 2015; Heinson et al., 2015; Soria-Guerra et al., 2015). Moreover, all of the putative target protein antigens can be identified, rather than identification being limited to those isolated from bacterial cultures (Xiang and He, 2009; Bowman et al., 2011). All of these advantages taken together led scientists to generate RV prediction programs. </p>
<p> Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have revolutionized drug discovery in general (Zhong et al., 2018; Duan et al., 2019; Lavecchia, 2019). AI has also led to the creation of many RV virtual frameworks, which are generally classified as rule-based filtering models (Naz et al., 2019; Ong et al., 2020a). Machine learning (ML) enables the creation of models that learn and generalize the patterns within the available data and can make inferences from previously unseen data. With the advent of deep learning (DL), the learning procedure can also include automatic feature extraction from raw data (Lecun et al., 2015). Moreover, it has recently been found that deep learning's feature extraction can result in superior performance compared to other computer-aided models (Ma et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018; Zhavoronkov et al., 2019). </p>
<p> In this review, we provide a survey of AI-based models for COVID-19 drug discovery and vaccine development. Moreover, we identify and evaluate the best candidate targets for future treatment development. We propose that a concerted effort should be made to leverage the knowledge from pre-existing data by using machine learning approaches. To that end, we present a wide-ranging collection of small molecules, peptides, and epitopes for therapy discovery that could also direct AI-based models, screening, or generation, in an intelligent manner. </p>
<p> Background of Machine Learning Methods for Therapy Discovery </p>
<p> In recent years, machine learning has revolutionized many fields of science and engineering. It has largely transformed our daily lives, from speech and face recognition (Alaghband et al., 2020; Grover and Toghi, 2020; Sun et al., 2020) to customized targeted advertisements (Zhai et al., 2016). The power of automatic abstract feature learning, combined with a massive volume of data, has immensely contributed to the successful application of ML (Lecun et al., 2015). Two of the most impactful areas affected are drug and vaccine discovery (Chen et al., 2018), in which ML has offered compound property prediction (Ma et al., 2015), activity prediction (Zhavoronkov et al., 2019), reaction prediction (Fooshee et al., 2018), and ligand–protein interaction. </p>
<p> On the prediction front, Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) have been the favorite tool for drug discovery applications (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Kearnes et al., 2016). These networks are able to handle graphs and extract features via encoding the adjacency information within the features. Successful representation learning from molecules using GCNNs has been demonstrated in drug property prediction (Heskett et al., 2018; Bazgir et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019), protein interface estimation (Fout et al., 2017), reactivity prediction (Coley et al., 2019), and drug–target interactions (Torng and Altman, 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Sequence-based models such as genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics have also gained some attention in recent years due to the advancements made in the natural language processing domain. The more recent generation of context-based models are transformers that use attention mechanisms and self-supervision to extract representations from sequences (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018). Transformers have demonstrated the capacity to predict drug–target interactions (Shin et al., 2019), model protein sequences (Choromanski et al., 2020), and predict retrosynthetic reactions. These models learn to extract features from sequences on the location, context, and order of the input tokens (Belinkov and Glass, 2018). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have successfully demonstrated the ability to perform when trained on molecules or protein sequences to predict secondary structure (Pollastri et al., 2002), quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling (Chakravarti et al., 2019), and function prediction (Liu, 2017). </p>
<p> On the lead generation front, de novo design has benefitted the most from the application of deep learning. This subfield has drastically evolved from its traditional usage of ligand-based models and creating molecules from sub-blocks (Acharya et al., 2010). The current approach involves the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create data-oriented molecules (Guimaraes et al., 2017). Traditional de novo design fails to fully implement this exploration by constraining the generation of molecules with ligand or fragment libraries. More recent approaches utilize deep learning generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAE) (De Cao and Kipf, 2018) in order to create sequences of atoms. This approach lifts the constraints of ligand-based designs and allows the generation of unique molecules with greater diversity (Guimaraes et al., 2017; De Cao and Kipf, 2018; Jin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Simonovsky and Komodakis, 2018). </p>
<p> Machine learning has also improved the field of vaccine design over the past two decades. VaxiJen was the first implementation of ML in RV approaches and has shown promising results for antigen prediction (Doytchinova and Flower, 2007; Heinson et al., 2017). In addition, the recent development of Vaxign-ML, a web-based RV program leveraging machine learning approaches for bacterial antigen prediction, is a testament to the success of exercising mathematical ML-based in RV (He et al., 2010a; Heinson et al., 2017). In essence, these pipelines consist of feature extraction, feature selection, data augmentation, and cross-validation implemented to predict vaccine candidates against various bacterial and viral pathogens known to cause infectious disease. The use of biological, structural, and physiochemical features is prevalent among the approaches in this domain, as seen in reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic methods such as IEDB and BlastP, which are feature extractors for AI-based models like RNN in the study of different pathogenic viruses (Flower et al., 2010; He and Zhu, 2015; Abbasi, 2020). More recently, graph-based features have also shown the ability to represent the antibodies instead of an expert-designed feature; Magar et al. showed that graph featurization is followed by mean pooling, and then classification is implemented using shallow and deep models (Magar et al., 2020). Deep Learning approaches have also revolutionized the field of cancer vaccinology through the improved prediction of neoantigens and their HLA binding affinity (Sher et al., 2017; Tran et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). Autoencoders of deep learning have shown promising improvement in extracting characteristics of human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA-A), which could be utilized in both transplantations and vaccine discovery (Miyake et al., 2018). </p>
<p> Key aspects of therapy discovery are safety and reliability. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Vaccine Safety Databank (VSD) have been among the most popular immunization registries for tracking, recording, and predicting vaccine safety. In prior decades, implementations of computational simulation and mathematical modeling have significantly improved the tradeoff between the assessment of safety and efficacy by using the aforementioned resources (He et al., 2010b; Vaishnav et al., 2015). Zheng et al. implemented Natural language Processing (NLP) for the identification of adverse events related to Tdap vaccines (Zheng et al., 2019). </p>
<p> In drug development cases, the final drug candidate produced in the process of drug discovery needs to be safe for human consumption. This requires an observation of the drug's side effects as well as confirmation that the drug is non-toxic. To accomplish this, the Toxicology in the 21st Century program (Tox-21) has screened ~10,000 compounds from 70 screening assays, creating a database that can be used to facilitate toxicity modeling. Furthermore, the project has also expanded to contain 700 assays with nearly 1,800 molecules in the ToxCast dataset. On the side-effect prevention front, the off-target interactions are predicted and minimized in silico. In doing so, potential drug candidates are chosen, with consideration given to their off-target polypharmacological profiles (Zhou H. et al., 2015). In a different approach, AI-based studies were implemented to detect the potential prolongation of QT intervals and cardiotoxicity of a candidate drug, hydroxychloroquine, using ECG data from smartwatches (Li J. et al., 2020)1. </p>
<p> In summary, artificial intelligence has been applied to many subfields of drug discovery and vaccine development. This improvement is crucial for the current situation and immediate SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery for several key reasons. Firstly, the automatic feature extraction ability of deep learning can support models with better accuracy and deliver more reliable results. Secondly, the generative ability demonstrated by deep learning models can be utilized to create more druggable molecules and better epitope prediction, lowering the chance of failure in the trial pipeline. Lastly, the novelty of the virus causes the data around its possible therapies to be scarce, which is a suitable scenario for transfer learning and leveraging the learned knowledge from previous tasks (e.g., TranscreenTM) (Salem et al., 2020). Transfer learning has been shown to alleviate this problem through the transferring of learned knowledge and parameters from a secondary task with big data available to the task at hand (Weiss et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of deep learning in therapy discovery for SARS-COV-2 is essential in order to make a timely and accurate response to the virus. </p>
<p> COVID-19 Molecular Mechanism and Target Selection </p>
<p> Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). They are known to infect both humans and other eukaryotes (Andersen et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020). The novel coronavirus manages to bind to the host receptor with a higher affinity than SARS due to the increased modification of its viral spike, among other structural proteins, resulting in enhanced transmission (Zhou Y. et al., 2020). </p>
<p> SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host cells begins with attachment via the viral spike (S) protein to the host ACE2 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou P. et al., 2020). ACE2 binding induces the host surface serine protease, TMPRSS2, to prime the S protein via cleavage at its S1/S2 border, facilitating viral fusion with the cell membrane (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Once inside the cell, the viral RNA genome is released into the cytosol, where it is translated by host ribosome machinery, producing two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab, which are then cleaved by viral 3CL protease (main protease) and PL protease. This gives rise to several non-structural proteins (nsps) as the foundation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP); this RdRP then transcribes a template strand of the genomic RNA, from which it then transcribes subgenomic mRNA products to be translated. These products encode the structural proteins S, E, M, and N, as well as additional accessory nsps (Figure 1) (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Kim D. et al., 2020). </p>
<p> FIGURE 1 </p>
<p> Figure 1. The pipeline of AI-based drug discovery and vaccine development for COVID-19. </p>
<p> The severity of the host response depends on an innate response to viral recognition, involving the expression of type-1 IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Pazhouhandeh et al., 2018; Prompetchara et al., 2020). If the antiviral response is delayed or inhibited, viral proliferation can lead to the large-scale recruitment of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages to the lungs, creating a hyperinflammatory environment (Prompetchara et al., 2020). Overactive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., cytokine storm (CS), has been found in COVID-19 patients and can lead to severe complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Moore and June, 2020). It has been found that levels of IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-10, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, and MIP1s are higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy adults (Huang et al., 2020). IL-6, in particular, has been highly implicated in CRS and COVID-19 severity, and inhibition of IL-6/IL-6R activity may lead to improved patient outcome, increasing its desirability as a target (Figure 1) (Scheller et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2016; Zhang C. et al., 2020). </p>
<p> Throughout the process of viral entry, replication, and dissemination, there are several proteins that can serve as suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. The S protein is one of the candidates receiving the most focus, as it is necessary for viral entry into host cells and is highly specific to the virus itself. The host receptor ACE2 is another possible target, but the presence of ACE2 in non-lung tissues such as heart, kidney, and intestine (Hamming et al., 2004) could complicate its inhibition. Another host protein, the TMPRSS2 protease, is essential for viral entry into the cell, making it an additional viable target (Hoffmann et al., 2020). </p>
<p> COVID-19 Drug Discovery </p>
<p> Protein-Based </p>
<p> The recent applications of Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 include the virtual screening of both repurposed drug candidates and new chemical entities. For repurposed drugs, the goal has been to rapidly predict and exploit interconnected biological pathways or the off-target biology of existing medicines that are proven safe and can thus be readily tested in new clinical trials. In one of the early attempts, Gordon et al. paved the way for the repurposing of candidate drugs by experimentally identifying 66 human proteins linked with 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Gordon et al., 2020). In addition to wet-lab approaches, network-based model simulation has been the main computational approach for analyzing the virus–host interactome (Messina et al., 2020). Li et al. identified 30 drugs for repurposing by analyzing the genome sequence of three main viral family members of the coronavirus and then relating them to the human disease-based pathways (Li X. et al., 2020). In a different approach, Zhou et al. offered a combination of network-based methodologies for repurposed drug combination (Zhou Y. et al., 2020). </p>
<p> UK-based BenevolentAI leveraged its AI-derived knowledge graph, which integrates biomedical data from structured and unstructured sources (Richardson et al., 2020). It targeted the inhibition of host protein AAK1 and identified Baricitinib, an approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Stebbing et al., 2020). Similarly, Beck et al. published an application of their DL-based drug–target interaction model that predicted commercially available antiviral drugs that may target the SARS-COV-2-related protease and helicase (Beck et al., 2020a). Atomwise has also focused on targeting several SARS-CoV-2 protein binding sites that are highly conserved across multiple coronavirus species in an effort to develop new broad-spectrum antivirals. Using its AtomNet® deep convolutional neural network technology (Wallach et al., 2020), Atomwise is screening millions of virtual compounds against these diverse targets alongside 15 different partnerships with academic researchers that will test the predicted compounds in their in vitro assays2. </p>
<p> There have been several other applications of multi-task deep learning models for identifying existing drugs that can target the main viral proteins, especially the main protease (3CLpro) and spike protein (Hu et al., 2020; Kadioglu et al., 2020; Kim J. et al., 2020; Redka et al., 2020). One impressive example is Cyclica's creation and mining of PolypharmDB, a platform of known drugs and their predicted binding to human protein targets that uncovered off-target applications of 30 existing drugs against the viral protein 3CLpro and the ACE2 binding site as two examples (Redka et al., 2020). At least two other applications of DL-based virtual screening for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease have been published and include the open sharing of newly predicted chemical structures (Bung et al., 2020; Zhang H. et al., 2020). </p>
<p> ML-aided molecular docking has been one of the most prevalent approaches for virtual screening. This process normally requires the following: (1) Dataset of Druglike or Approved Molecules, (2) Crystal Structure or Homology Model of the target, (3) Molecular Docking Program, and (4) Compute Resources (Ewing et al., 2001; Pagadala et al., 2017). Through docking, many molecules have been reported to fit the binding site of various SARS-CoV-2 proteins essential for viral replication and infection. 3CLpro, Spike Protein, RdRP, and PLpro are among those screened, as well as the host ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 protease (Chen et al., 2020; Choudhary et al., 2020; Kong R. et al., 2020; Smith and Smith, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). As an example, Ton et al. identified at least 1000 protease inhibitors by creating and utilizing the Deep Docking (DD) network technology approach. However, as they used the QSAR for training their model, no novel docking score was provided (Ton et al., 2020). </p>
<p> It is clear that 3CLpro is the most popular target for virtual screening (Figure 1). The main reason for this is its pivotal role in viral replication and transcription and its well-defined structural information. Viral protease inhibitors have been extensively studied as treatments for other viruses. In addition, deep learning-aided approaches have been the main focus of research, as their automatic feature extraction accelerates discovery. The datasets cited often rely on the ZINC database (Wu et al., 2020), while other screened datasets include the FDA-approved LOPAC library (Choudhary et al., 2020), SWEETLEAD library (Smith and Smith, 2020), or all purchasable drugs (Drugs-lib) (Chen et al., 2020). Moreover this review sampled a variety of publications witch used different computational resources. It can be carried out on a small scale on a MacOS Mojave Workstation with an 8 core Zeon E5 processor or on a large scale as with the world's strongest supercomputer, SUMMIT, for enhanced parallelization (Choudhary et al., 2020; Smith and Smith, 2020). </p>
<p> RNA-Based </p>
<p> Conserved structured elements have already been shown to play critical functional roles in the life cycles of Coronaviruses (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). Through direct interactions with host RNA-binding proteins and helicases, structural elements add a layer of complexity to the regulatory information that is encoded in the viral RNA. Targeted disruption of the regulatory functions of these structural elements provides a largely unexplored strategy that can limit viral loads with minimal impact on the biology of normal cells (Park et al., 2011). While this idea would have been farfetched a mere 5 years ago, advances in AI-driven computational modeling and high-throughput experimental RNA shape analyses have all but overcome the critical barriers (Alipanahi et al., 2015). </p>
<p> Highly conserved RNA structural elements have been identified in a number of viral families, many of which have been functionally validated (Jaafar and Kieft, 2019). Some of these stem loops in SARS-CoV-2′s 5′UTRs structural elements are conserved across beta coronaviruses and are known to impact viral replication (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). There are many functional RNA structural elements that fall within the coding sequence and the 3′UTR as well (Plant and Dinman, 2008; Stammler et al., 2011). Rangan et al. identified 106 structurally conserved regions that would be suitable biotargets for unexplored antiviral agents (Rangan et al., 2020). Moreover, they predicted at least 59 unstructured regions that are conserved within SARS-CoV-2. Park et al. identified an RNA Pseudoknot-Binding molecule against SARS-CoV-1 in target-based virtual screening (Park et al., 2011; Nakagawa et al., 2016). </p>
<p> Studying the changes in RNA information also allows for the identification of new and evolved targets. In a different approach, Wu et al. showed that a recently FDA-approved drug named Remdesivir could bind to the RNA-binding channel of the novel coronavirus. They discovered other candidate drugs via analyzing the proteins critical to RNA processing and pathways (Wu et al., 2020). It seems that viral genome, RdRP, and processed mRNA would make promising targets for drug repurposing. </p>
<p> Generative Approaches </p>
<p> Molecule generation has been one of the fields of drug discovery that have been most revolutionized by the implementation of artificial intelligence over the last decade. As mentioned, VAE is a generator model for enhancing the diversity of generated data. Autoencoders instruct molecules into a vector that captures properties such as bond order, element, and functional group (Bjerrum and Sattarov, 2018). Chenthamarakshan et al., together with IBM Research, demonstrated a VAE that captures molecules in a latent space. Once captured, variations are made on the original molecule vectors based on desired properties. These can then be decoded back into novel molecules (Chenthamarakshan et al., 2020). To optimize the structures, QED, Synthetic Accessibility, and LogP regressors were used to improve the latent space variations. </p>
<p> In a different approach, Tang et al. overcame many of the issues with traditional generative models by developing a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD). This allowed for the enhanced exploration of space by assembling SARS-CoV-2 molecules one fragment at a time rather than relying on latent space adjustments. After making connections and rewarding molecules with the most druglike connections, a pharmacophore and descriptor filter was used to refine the set. They demonstrated a robust method for designing novel, high-binding compounds refined to the structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro (Tang et al., 2020). To design a drug-generative network, the following is necessary: (1) collection of Druglike Molecules, (2) a representation of these molecules in silico (i.e., Fingerprints, Tokenizers), (3) a method of altering molecules to increase diversity, and (4) screening and modification of the altered molecules. Pursuing GAN-related models, Insilico Medicine used three of its previously validated generative chemistry approaches to target the main protease, namely, crystal-derived pocked-based generation, homology modeling-based generation, and ligand-based generation (Zhavoronkov et al., 2020). Similar to target-based virtual screening, the main protease has been the main object of interest for scientists for de novo drug discovery. </p>
<p> COVID-19 Vaccine Discovery </p>
<p> Identification of the best possible targets for the development of a vaccine is crucial in order to counteract a virus's high infection rate (Choudhary et al., 2020). A host immune system fights virus-infected cells either through the production of antibodies by B cells or through the direct attack of T cells (Amanat and Krammer, 2020). The HLA gene encodes MCH-I and MCH-II proteins, which present epitopes as antigenic determinants. These proteins assist B-cell and T-cell antibodies in their ability to bind and attack invaders (Dangi et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2020; Smith and Smith, 2020). Machine learning approaches, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recursive Feature Selection (RFE), have been basic tools for identifying antigens from protein sequences (Bowick et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2019). However, due to their low sensitivity in the prediction of locally clustered interactions in some cases, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have been a more valid alternative for the binding prediction of MHC and peptides (Han and Kim, 2017). </p>
<p> Since the outbreak of this first coronavirus, different AI-based approaches have been used to predict potential epitopes so as to design vaccines (Park et al., 2011; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015; Ton et al., 2020). Fast and Chen used MARIA (Chen et al., 2019) and NetMHCPan4 (Jurtz et al., 2017), two supervised neural network-driven tools, to discover potential T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 close to the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Fast and Chen, 2020). The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network has also shown some promising results. Abbasi et al. used this type of RNN to predict epitopes for Spike (Abbasi, 2020). Using a similar tactic, Crossman et al. employed deep-learning RNN and provided simulated sequences of Spike to identify possible targets for vaccine design (Crossman, 2020). RNN provided the sequences for a protein of interest with high sequence identity to the BLAST match. </p>
<p> Using a separate method, Feng et al. leveraged the iNeo tool to design a vaccine containing both B-cell and T-cell epitopes. This multi-peptide vaccine could provide a new strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, they discovered 17 vaccine peptides involving both immune cells (Nakagawa et al., 2016; Rangan et al., 2020). Ong et al. used Vaxign-RV to prioritize non-structural proteins as vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 (Ong et al., 2020b). Nsp3, the largest non-structural protein of the coronavirus family, was identified as the most promising potential target for vaccine development after Spike (Ong et al., 2020b). Malone et al. also studied the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome beyond Spike and provided a comprehensive vaccine design blueprint for SARS-CoV-2 using NEC Immune Profiler, IEDB, and BepiPred tools to create an epitope map for different HLA alleles (Malone et al., 2020). </p>
<p> Natural language processing models, specifically language modeling techniques, have also made an impact in the domain of COVID-19 vaccine discovery. Pre-trained transformers were used to predict protein interaction (Nambiar et al., 2020) and model molecular reactions in carbohydrate chemistry (Pesciullesi et al., 2020), which can be utilized in the process of vaccine development. Chen et al. discussed the use-case of an LSTM-based seq-2-seq model for predicting the secondary structure of certain SARS-COV-2 proteins (Karpov et al., 2019)3. Also, Beck et al. used transformers to repurpose commercially available drugs by predicting their interactions with viral proteins of SARS-COV-2 (Beck et al., 2020b). </p>
<p> Taking this work together, it is clear that spike protein has been the most popular candidate for virtual vaccine discovery (Oany et al., 2014). As the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 is crucial for viral entry, specific neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of Spike can interrupt the attachment and fusion of viral proteins (Wan et al., 2019). This method could provide simulated sequences that can serve as a guide for further vaccine discovery against COVID-19 and possibly new zoonosis that may arise in the future. </p>
<p> Data Collection </p>
<p> Data-driven solutions rely on patterns embedded in the data in order to extract mathematical models. That being said, a data collection campaign will face a plethora of challenges in the case of any recently emerged virus, primarily due to the existence of bias and imbalance in the limited data available. Therefore, even the most sophisticated of modeling approaches will be ineffective when trained on such datasets. In order to overcome this issue, we compiled a multifaceted and comprehensive investigation of the existing literature, datasets, and online resources to provide potential small molecules, peptides, and epitopes. Such elements can be beneficial in the process of discovering or designing novel drugs to treat COVID-19 when used with both conventional and data-driven AI-based approaches. </p>
<p> We choose to focus on both potential antiviral agents and host biotarget inhibitors. The provided data entitled CoronaDB-AI in Table 1 includes the small molecules and peptides proposed by both in-silico and in-vitro approaches. In addition to candidate scaffolds against the coronavirus's structural proteins, the potential inhibition of other respiratory tract viruses is taken into consideration to increase the therapeutic potential. Antimicrobial peptides have been validated as potent antivirals that disrupt either the viral membrane or an additional molecular mechanism of the virus (Akaji et al., 2011; Han and Kraí, 2020; Xia et al., 2020). As described before, the cytokine storm and an elevated immune response of the host plays a vital role in disease complication, so candidate immunosuppressants were also added as host-targeted agents. In addition to the potency of a candidate drug, it is crucial that the drug have high selectivity and low toxicity. Therefore, we also gathered a complete toxicity dataset from distinct databases, including ToxCast and Tox21. Finally, we gathered a comprehensive epitope-based dataset that could also guide deep learning-based models for improved vaccine development and epitope generation. </p>

<p> Discussion </p>
<p> SARS-COV-2 rapidly transformed into a global challenge, costing thousands of lives, overwhelming healthcare systems, and threatening the economy all around the world. As we demonstrated above, it can be extremely challenging to experimentally perform a comprehensive potency evaluation of all drug and vaccine candidates in a timely fashion. We believe that leveraging computational models capable of filtering and generating reliable therapies can significantly speed up these discovery efforts. Employing artificial neural networks and supervised learning methods has proven to be a vital game-changer when used for the purpose of virtual filtering and de novo design. However, in order to achieve the desired performance in such intelligent methods, one requires the knowledge to recognize the most relevant biotargets in addition to a large-scale training dataset. This fact motivated us to perform a survey of biotargets that have been employed in the virtual drug and vaccine discovery literature. We observed that the viral spike protein and the main protease have been the most prevalent choices for vaccine development and drug discovery, respectively, due to their importance. Furthermore, we gathered a list of datasets titled “CoronaDB-AI” that can be used for our particular application. Having access to these key elements removes the burden of collecting training data and the required knowledge for both computer scientists and bioinformaticians and consequently enhances research outcomes. </p>

<p> Organizations have been quick to apply their AI and machine learning know-how in the fight to curb this pandemic. </p>
<p> These technologies are being deployed in areas from research to healthcare and even agriculture. </p>
<p> As the world grapples with COVID-19, every ounce of technological innovation and ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic brings us one step closer to overcoming it. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are playing a key role in better understanding and addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Machine learning technology enables computers to mimic human intelligence and ingest large volumes of data to quickly identify patterns and insights. </p>
<p> In the fight against COVID-19, organizations have been quick to apply their machine learning expertise in several areas: scaling customer communications, understanding how COVID-19 spreads, and speeding up research and treatment. </p>
<p> Have you read? </p>
<p> Enabling organizations to scale and adjust </p>
<p> Every kind of organization, whether small or large, public or private, is finding new ways to operate effectively and to meet the needs of their customers and employees as social distancing and quarantine measures remain in place. Machine learning technology is playing an important role in enabling that shift by providing the tools to support remote communication, enable telemedicine, and protect food security. </p>
<p> For healthcare and government institutions, that includes using machine learning-enabled chatbots for contactless screening of COVID-19 symptoms and to answer questions from the public. One example is Clevy.io, a French start-up and AWS customer, which has launched a chatbot to make it easier for people to find official government communications about COVID-19. Powered by real-time information from the French government and the World Health Organization, the chatbot assesses known symptoms and answers questions about government policies. With almost 3 million messages sent to-date, this chatbot is able to answer questions on everything from exercise to an evaluation of COVID-19 risks, without further straining the resources of healthcare and government institutions. French cities including Strasbourg, Orléans and Nanterre are using the chatbot to decentralize the distribution of accurate, verified information. </p>
<p> To avoid any disruption to the food supply chain, food processors and governments need to understand the current state of agriculture. Agri-tech start-up Mantle Labs, another AWS customer, is offering its cutting-edge AI-driven crop-monitoring solution to retailers free of charge for a period of three months to provide additional resiliency and certainty to supply chains in the UK. The technology works to assess satellite images of crops to flag potential issues to farmers and retailers early on so they can better manage supply, procurement and inventory planning. The platform deploys custom machine learning models to mix imagery from multiple satellites, enabling a near real-time assessment of agricultural conditions. </p>
<p> Health, pandemics, epidemics </p>
<p> What is the World Economic Forum doing about fighting pandemics? </p>
<p> The first human trial of a COVID-19 vaccine was administered this week. </p>
<p> CEPI, launched at the World Economic Forum, provided funding support for the Phase 1 study. The organization this week announced their seventh COVID-19 vaccine project in the fight against the pandemic. </p>
<p> The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in 2017 at the Forum's Annual Meeting – bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and to enable access to these vaccines during outbreaks. </p>
<p> Coalitions like CEPI are made possible through public-private partnerships. The World Economic Forum is the trusted global platform for stakeholder engagement, bringing together a range of multistakeholders from business, government and civil society to improve the state of the world. </p>
<p> Organizations can partner with the Forum to contribute to global health solutions. Contact us to find out how. </p>

<p> Understanding how COVID-19 spreads </p>
<p> Machine learning is also helping researchers and practitioners analyze large volumes of data to forecast the spread of COVID-19, in order to act as an early warning system for future pandemics and to identify vulnerable populations. Researchers at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California have built a model to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections that go undetected and the consequences for public health, analyzing 12 regions across the globe. Using machine learning and partnering with the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, they have developed new methods to quantify undetected infections – analyzing how the virus mutates as it spreads through the population to infer how many transmissions have been missed. </p>
<p> At the beginning of this pandemic, BlueDot, a Canadian start-up and AWS customer that uses AI to detect disease outbreaks, was one of the first to raise the alarm about a worrisome outbreak of a respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. BlueDot uses AI to detect disease outbreaks. Using their machine learning algorithms, BlueDot sifts through news reports in 65 languages, along with airline data and animal disease networks to detect outbreaks and anticipate the dispersion of disease. Epidemiologists then review those results and verify that the conclusions make sense from a scientific standpoint. BlueDot provides those insights to public health officials, airlines and hospitals to help them anticipate and better manage risks. </p>
<p> Machine learning is helping leaders make more informed decisions in the face of COVID-19. In March, a group of volunteer professionals, led by former White House Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil, reached out to AWS for help supporting a scenario-planning tool that modelled the potential impact of COVID-19 in order to answer questions like: “How many hospital beds will we need?” or “For how long should we issue a shelter-in-place order?” They needed to scale their open-source model so governors across the US could understand the volume of exposure, infection and hospitalization to better inform their response plans. In close partnership with AWS and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the group moved the model to the cloud, allowing them to run multiple scenarios in just hours and to roll out the model to all 50 states and internationally to help with making decisions that directly impact the global spread of COVID-19. </p>
<p> Organizations are also examining ways to limit the spread of COVID-19, particularly among vulnerable populations. Closedloop, an AI start-up that we work with, is using their expertise in healthcare data to identify those at the highest risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Closedloop has developed and open-sourced a COVID vulnerability index, an AI-based predictive model that identifies people most at-risk of severe complications from COVID-19. This 'C-19 Index' is being used by healthcare systems, care management organizations and insurance companies to identify high-risk individuals, then calling them to share the importance of handwashing and social distancing, and also offering to deliver food, toilet paper, and other essential supplies so they can stay at home. </p>
<p> Speeding up research and treatment </p>
<p> Healthcare providers and researchers are faced with an exponentially increasing volume of information about COVID-19, which makes it difficult to derive insights that can inform treatment. In response, AWS launched CORD-19 Search, a new search website powered by machine learning, that can help researchers quickly and easily search for research papers and documents and answer questions like “When is the salivary viral load highest for COVID-19?” </p>
<p> Built on the Allen Institute for AI’s CORD-19 open research dataset of more than 128,000 research papers and other materials, this machine learning solution can extract relevant medical information from unstructured text and delivers robust natural-language query capabilities, helping to accelerate the pace of discovery. </p>
<p> In the field of medical imaging, meanwhile, researchers are using machine learning to help recognize patterns in images, enhancing the ability of radiologists to indicate the probability of disease and diagnose it earlier. </p>
<p> UC San Diego Health has engineered a new method to diagnose pneumonia earlier, a condition associated with severe COVID-19. This early detection helps doctors quickly triage patients to the appropriate level of care even before a COVID-19 diagnosis is confirmed. Trained with 22,000 notations by human radiologists, the machine learning algorithm overlays x-rays with colour-coded maps that indicate pneumonia probability. With credits donated from the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, these methods have now been deployed to every chest x-ray and CT scan throughout UC San Diego Health in a clinical research study. </p>
<p> Machine learning can also help accelerate the discovery of drugs to help treat COVID-19. BenevolentAI, a UK AI company and AWS customer, turned its platform toward understanding the body’s response to the coronavirus. They launched an investigation using their AI drug discovery platform to identify approved drugs which could potentially inhibit the progression of the novel coronavirus. They used machine learning to help derive contextual relationships between genes, diseases and drugs, leading to the proposal of a small number of drug compounds. In just days, BenevolentAI found that Baricitinib (a drug currently approved for rheumatoid arthritis, owned by Eli Lilly) proved the strongest candidate. Baricitinib is now in late-stage clinical trials with the US National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to investigate its efficacy and safety as a potential treatment for COVID-19 patients. The speed with which the drug entered clinical trials reflects the urgency of the global pandemic and the significance of AI in facilitating the discovery of new treatments. </p>
<p> I'm inspired and encouraged by the speed at which these organizations are applying machine learning to address COVID-19. I have always believed in the potential of machine learning to help solve the biggest challenges in our world - and that promise is now coming to fruition as organizations respond to this crisis. It is my hope that in this difficult time we can work together on a global scale to innovate and find new ways machine learning can contribute in the fight against COVID-19. </p>

<p> How AI is being used for COVID-19 vaccine creation and distribution </p>
<p> Artificial intelligence is being used in a variety of ways by those trying to address variants and for data management. </p>
<p> Millions of people across the world have already started the process of receiving a COVID-19 vaccines. More than half of all adults in the U.S. have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine while state and local officials seek to get even more people vaccinated as quickly as possible. Some health experts have said artificial intelligence will be integral not just in managing the process of creating boosters for the variants to COVID-19 but also for the distribution of the vaccine. </p>
<p> David Smith, associate VP of virtual medicine at UMass Memorial Health Care, explained that the difference between predictive modeling and AI, or machine learning, is that predictive models depend on past data to foretell future events. </p>
<p> AI, on the other hand, not only uses historical data, it makes assumptions about the data without applying a defined set of rules, Smith said. </p>
<p> "This allows the software to learn and adapt to information patterns in more real time. The AI utility for vaccine distribution could be applied in a variety of ways from understanding which populations to target to curve the pandemic sooner, adjusting supply chain and distribution logistics to ensure the most people get vaccinated in the least amount of time, to tracking adverse reactions and side effects," he noted. </p>
<p> Matthew Putman, an expert in artificial intelligence and CEO of Nanotronics, has been working with one of the top vaccine developers and said AI was helping teams manage the deluge of data that comes with a project like this. </p>
<p> While the number of vaccinated people in the country continues to rise by the millions each day, there is already some concern about how the vaccines will hold up against the multitude of variants. </p>
<p> The biggest challenge right now and the biggest opportunity for changing the way that therapeutics are both developed and deployed, Putman explained, is being able to handle new types of variants. </p>
<p> "In the case of mRNA vaccines, being able to actually do reprogramming as fast as possible in a way that is as coordinated as possible. The things that we have realized in many parts of our lives now is that as good as humans are at exploring things and being creative, being able to deal with enough data and to be able to make intelligent choices about that data is something that actually artificial intelligence agents can do at a pace that is required to keep up with this," Putman said. </p>
<p> "So it means a lot of multivariate correlations to different parts of the process. It means being able to detect potential intrusion and it's a way that we can avoid these lengthy phase three trials. Everything that's going on right now is so incredibly urgent." </p>
<p> Putman added that an AI system would help with building actionable data sets that allow doctors to examine root causes or things that researchers don't have time to spend on. </p>
<p> When researchers are dealing with things like lipid nanoparticles and the tasks of imaging and classifying different features and trends that are on a scale, it can be difficult for humans to manage. AI is now being used for analyzing these images in real time and has helped researchers try to pick out genetic mutations and variations, according to Putman. </p>
<p> "People are more open to AI than ever, and this emergency has brought a focus on things that probably would have been on the backburner. But AI is starting to be used for classification and to understand what genomic features and what type of nano compounding has been going on," Putman added. </p>
<p> "AI has been used for the development of components and much more. It's been crucial to the process and will be crucial to an alteration to the vaccine, which is looking like it will have to be done at some point. The way I look at contemporary AI systems, it's taking into account what move is being made next. This is Alpha Go for drug discovery. A virus will mutate in different ways and now a response to that can be developed in new ways." </p>
<p> Putman went on to compare the situation to the yearly creation of a new flu vaccine, noting that once you've grown a lot of biological specimens, it's a slow tedious process to change for new mutations. </p>
<p> "Using mRNA, it's not, and using AI for being able to see what changes are going on from everywhere from the sequence to the quality inspection is a big deal," Putman said. </p>
<p> When asked about the production of boosters for variants, Putman said adjusting a process usually takes years just for a normal product, and if you're doing something as new as what is going on with the vaccine and you're dealing with the entirety of the supply chain, the process has to be adjusted as fast as the science does. </p>
<p> "We have the science now. We've shown that these types of vaccines can be developed. Now, making sure that your production process stays the same, even if you've adjusted something else, is something that if it's put in place, the process will adjust," Putman said. </p>
<p> "If an AI system worked for this or an intelligent factory system is put into place, then the process can adjust as quickly as the R&D can. Without AI, it would be very difficult." </p>
<p> Cheryl Rodenfels, a healthcare strategist at Nutanix, echoed those remarks, explaining that AI can be an incredibly useful tool when it comes to vaccine distribution. </p>
<p> Organizations that utilize workflow improvement processes can harness AI tools to ensure that the processes are being followed as designed and that any missing elements are identified, Rodenfels said, adding that this process plays into vaccine tracking measures specifically, as AI will track vaccine handling, storage and administration. </p>
<p> "Relying on the technology to manage distribution data eliminates human error, and ensures that healthcare organizations are accurately tracking the vast amounts of data associated with the vaccine rollout," Rodenfels said. </p>
<p> "However, the biggest problem with using AI to assist with vaccine rollout is that each manufacturer has its own process and procedure for the handling, storage, tracking, training and administration of the vaccine. This is then complicated by the amount of manufacturers in the market. Another issue is that hospital pharmacies and labs don't have a lot of extra space to stage and set up the doses. In order to insert effective AI, a hospital would need to ensure a process architect and a data scientist work collaboratively." </p>
<p> These issues are compounded by the fact that there is no baseline for how these things are supposed to work, she noted. The measurements, analytics and information will be developed on the fly, and because it is unknown how many vaccines each organization will be required or allowed to have, it is difficult to predict the capacity or amount of data that will be produced. </p>
<p> The advantage to using AI in vaccine rollout is that it will set us up for success during round two of vaccine dosing. It will also positively impact future vaccine dissemination by creating a blueprint for the next mass inoculation need, both Rodenfels and Putman said. </p>
<p> Walter McAdams, SQA Group senior vice president of solutions delivery, said that AI will be useful in analyzing how the virus is mutating over time, how variations could affect current vaccine make-ups, and how to use that information to accelerate the development of virus countermeasures. </p>
<p> Researchers, he said, can leverage data about how COVID-19 has mutated and vaccine effectiveness to continuously refine the vaccine sequence and, in some cases, get ahead of COVID-19 and prepare new vaccines before additional strains fully develop. </p>

<p> AI Can Help Scientists Find a Covid-19 Vaccine </p>
<p> Artificial intelligence has already played a vital role in the outbreak since day 1—a reminder for the first time in a while that it can be a tool for good. </p>
<p> AI has gotten something of a bad rap in recent years, but the Covid-19 pandemic illustrates how AI can do a world of good in the race to find a vaccine. AI is playing two important supporting roles in this quest: suggesting components of a vaccine by understanding viral protein structures, and helping medical researchers scour tens of thousands of relevant research papers at an unprecedented pace. Over the last few weeks, teams at the Allen Institute for AI, Google DeepMind, and elsewhere have created AI tools, shared data sets and research results, and shared them freely with the global scientific community. </p>
<p> Vaccines imitate an infection, causing the body to produce defensive white-blood cells and antigens. There are three main types of vaccines: whole-pathogen vaccines, like those for the flu or MMR, use killed or weakened pathogens to elicit an immune response; subunit vaccines, (e.g., pertussis, shingles) use only part of the germ, such as a protein; and nucleic acid vaccines inject genetic material of the pathogen into human cells to stimulate an immune response. The latter is the type of vaccine targeting Covid-19 that began trials this week in the United States. AI is useful in accelerating the development of subunit and nucleic acid vaccines. </p>
<p> An essential part of viruses, proteins are made up of a sequence of amino acids that determine its unique 3D shape. Understanding a protein’s structure is essential to understanding how it works. Once the shape is understood, scientists can develop drugs that work with the protein’s unique shape. But it would take longer than the age of the known universe to examine all possible shapes of a protein before finding its unique 3D structure. Enter AI. </p>
<p> In January, Google DeepMind introduced AlphaFold, a cutting-edge system that predicts the 3D structure of a protein based on its genetic sequence. In early March, the system was put to the test on Covid-19. DeepMind released protein structure predictions of several under-studied proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, to help the research community better understand the virus. </p>
<p> At the same time, researchers from The University of Texas at Austin and the National Institutes of Health used a popular biology technique to create the first 3D atomic scale map of the part of the virus that attaches to and infects human cells—the spike protein. The team responsible for this critical breakthrough had spent years working on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One of the predictions released by AlphaFold provided an accurate prediction for this spike structure. </p>
<p> Another effort at the University of Washington’s Institute for Protein Design also used computer models to develop 3D atomic-scale models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that closely match those discovered in the UT Austin lab. They are now building on this work by creating new proteins to neutralize coronavirus. In theory, these proteins would stick to the spike protein preventing viral particles from infecting healthy cells. </p>
<p> More broadly, scientific research on Covid-19 requires a Herculean effort to keep up with the results emerging from other labs. Learning about work at another lab can save months or even years of work by moving past a blind alley, avoiding reinventing the wheel, or suggesting a shortcut. Labs report their work via published articles and increasingly via preprint services like bioRxiv and medRxiv. </p>
<p> Several thousand papers relevant to Covid-19 have appeared in the first three months of 2020, and the scientific literature is growing rapidly. As a result, scientists struggle to find the papers relevant to their specific research, to review the breadth of recent findings, and uncover insights. The first challenge is to collect the relevant literature and put it in a single, accessible location. In response, we at Allen Institute for AI have partnered with several research organizations to produce the Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a unique resource of over 44,000 scholarly articles about Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. It’s updated daily as new research is published. This freely available data set is machine-readable, so researchers can create and apply natural-language processing algorithms, and hopefully accelerate the discovery of a vaccine. </p>
<p> A coalition including the White House, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research, and the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health came together to provide this service. In addition, Google’s machine-learning and data science platform Kaggle is hosting the Covid-19 Research Challenge, which aims to provide a broad range of insights about the pandemic, including the natural history; transmission and diagnostics for the virus; lessons from previous epidemiological studies; and more. The research challenge was released on March 16. Within five days it had already garnered over 500,000 views, and been downloaded more than 18,000 times. Recent findings from the research community are curated on a single webpage for quick reference. </p>
<p> The most tantalizing prospect for automated analysis of the scientific literature is that AI will connect the dots between studies to identify hypotheses and suggest experiments, and even treatment, that would otherwise be missed. Literature-based discovery is a class of analysis methods invented by the researcher Don R. Swanson in 1988. His automated system discovered a novel treatment for migraines: magnesium. Work on literature-based discovery has continued, and its potential impact has grown with the introduction of deep-learning-based NLP tools such as SciBert. </p>
<p> In addition to supporting the research community in their efforts to understand the virus and develop treatments, AI has played a vital role in the Covid-19 outbreak since day 1. AI startup Bluedot detected a cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan in late December and accurately predicted where the virus might spread. Robots have been reducing human interaction by disinfecting hospital rooms, moving food and supplies, and delivering telehealth consultations. AI is being used to track and map the spread of infection in real time, diagnose infections, predict mortality risk, and more. And the potential for future innovation cannot be overlooked. </p>
<p> Despite this burst of activity, we emphasize that AI is far from a silver bullet in fighting Covid-19. On the contrary, modern AI methods require large amounts of labeled data to be effective, and that data isn’t currently available. Even when data is available, human judgment is essential to carefully analyze AI’s pattern recognition. </p>
<p> While the jury is still out on AI’s contributions in the coming weeks, it’s clear that the AI community has enlisted to fight Covid-19. It is ironic that the AI which has caused such consternation with facial recognition, deepfakes, and such is now at the front lines of helping scientists confront Covid-19 and future pandemics. </p>
<p> Contrary to its depiction in science fiction stories and Hollywood films, AI has emerged as a powerful technology for processing massive amounts of information. As such, it can be used beneficially but also to forge documents, images, videos, or even identities, to perpetuate biases, for surveillance, and worse. Our use of AI to fight Covid-19 reminds us that AI is a tool, not a being, and it’s up to us to employ this tool for the common good. </p>
